Registration Entry Requirements {#registration-entry-requirements}
==================================================================

A registration entry is a document describing one or several metadata entry,
and has the following requirements:
1. Each metadata entry is defined as a separate {{VideoFrameMetadata}}
    dictionary member.
2. Each metadata entry must be serializable.
3. Each metadata must be defined by a W3C specification and have clearly defined semantics.
    In particular, its interactions with the media processing pipeline
    (encoders, decoders, renderers, etc.) should be well defined.
4. A candidate registration entry must be announced by filing an issue in the
    WebCodecs GitHub issue tracker so they can be discussed and evaluated for
    compliance before being added to the registry. If the Media Working Group
    reaches consensus to accept the candidate, a pull request should be drafted
    (either by editors or by the party requesting the candidate registration)
    to register the candidate. The registry editors will review and merge the
    pull request.
